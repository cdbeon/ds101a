<p>Hi! My name is Chandler and I'll be your instructor for the course. I'm currently a first-year PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles studying Medical Informatics (tl;dr: developing AI for medical purposes). I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2022 with a double major in Data Science (w/ a concentration in Computational Biology) and Molecular & Cell Biology. </p>  

<p>I have taught a few university-level courses before, but the one I am the most familiar with (and have extensively taught over the course of 2 years) is Introduction to Probability and Statistics in Biology and Public Health (search up PH142 @ Berkeley if you're interested).</p>  

<p> Looking forward to the semester! </p>
