I'm currently a first-year PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles studying Medical Informatics (tl;dr: developing AI for medical purposes). I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2022 with a double major in Data Science (w/ a concentration in Computational Biology) and Molecular &amp; Cell Biology. I have taught a few university-level courses before, but the one I am the most familiar with (and have extensively taught over the course of 2 years) is Introduction to Probability and Statistics in Biology and Public Health (search up PH142 @ Berkeley if you're interested). Looking forward to the semester! . ",

    "content": "Data Science (DS) 101A is the first course of a two-part series that teaches the foundations of conducting an independent research project using data science applications. DS 101A, which spans over the course of 15 weeks, covers a combination of basic coding principles and skills required to explore and analyze datasets. Students will learn how to use a dataset to conduct exploratory data analysis and create visualizations to help convey their results to a proper audience. Below are the main units covered throughout the course and their learning objectives. After each unit, students will be able to: . | Unit 1: Basic Programming Principles in Python . | Understand Python syntax | Create user-defined functions to solve specific problems | Create a custom class object to structurer an entity | Become comfortable with working in a Jupyter environment | . | Unit 2: Dataset Analysis and Manipulation using Pandas . | Read in a dataset into a Pandas dataframe | Select columns and filter rows in a dataframe | Calculate aggregate statistics | Clean the dataset via manipulation | . | Unit 3: Creating Visualizations . | Create simple (sub)plots from a Pandas dataframe | Customize the plots with proper labels and titles | Select the proper visualization for a specific question | . | Unit 4: Statistics and Inference . | Describe the dataset using statistical terms | Understand the difference between parametric and non-parametric tests | Conduct hypothesis testing with one-sample and two-sample datasets | Select the proper test to use depending on the question | . | . Please note that this class is modeled similarly to a university-level course, meaning that the pace may be faster than what students are normally used to. ",

This course will be offered during Summer/Fall 2025. Some of the topics that will be covered include creating a research proposal, conducting a literature review, and understanding the anatomy of an academic paper. Unlike DS 101A, DS 101B is has an emphasis on independent work and will require more effort from the student to meet assignment deadlines. A more comprehensive syllabus of the course will be released closer to the start of its offering date. The course will be offered in the summer/fall of 2025. ",

    "content": "Lecture . There will be a synchronous, online weekly lecture every Thursday from 8:00 – 9:30 PM PT. Please refer to the course calendar for dates and additional details. Lecture is mandatory, and students are expected to attend every week. If a student has three unexcused absences, they will be automatically dropped from the course. If you have a concern about not being able to make a future lecture due to prior engagements or are facing an emergency situation, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. Office Hours . Office hours are dedicated sessions where students can ask questions or request additional help from instructors. Although office hours are optional, they are highly recommended if you require any additional help with any of the content or assignments. Dedicated office hours are weekly on Wednesday from 8:00 – 9:30 PM PT. If you cannot make this time, please contact the instructor to schedule an alternative time. Homework . Homeworks are week-long assignments that are designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of ideas presented in lecture. Homeworks will be graded on a completion-basis, meaning that students will receive credit as long as they complete the entirety of the assignment with ample effort. Homework solutions will be posted shortly after the following lecture. Assignments will be released promptly after lecture and are due by 11:59 PM PT on Wednesday of the following week, unless otherwise stated. Deadlines are subject to change. Final Project . For Data Science 101A, there will be a final project towards the end of the semester. This project is meant to be a culmination of everything that was covered in Data Science 101A, in lieu of exams. Details of the final project will be released at a later date. ",

Academic Integrity and Collaboration Policy . Collaboration is heavily encouraged in research to promote sharing ideas and perspectives. However, when it comes to learning, there is a fine line between collaboration and cheating. You are encouraged to talk to other classmates about methods to solutions, but sharing code and answers is considered academic misconduct. Evidence of academic misconduct will result in immediate removal from the course. Please make sure your solutions are your own – besides, the best way to learn something is to go through the whole mile of understanding and learning! . Wellness Policy . Understandably, juggling this course and your many other responsibilities can get overwhelming. If you ever feel like you are struggling to keep up, please contact the instructor as soon as possible! We want you to succeed and move on to DS 101B so that you can have something substantial when you apply for college 😊 . Course Flexibility . Please be advised that this is the first iteration of the course, meaning that there’s a lot of changes that can happen throughout the semester. I will do my best to plan everything ahead, but I appreciate your understanding if there are any last-minute changes. I will also do my best to communicate any changes well ahead in time! . ",
